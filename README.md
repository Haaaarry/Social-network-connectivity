# Social-network-connectivity
在一个社交网络中，有M条记录，每条记录某两个人加为好友的时间，N个人，要求设计算法求出所有人建立关系的时间
given a social network containing n members and a log file containing m timestamps at which times pairs of members formed friendships, design an algorithm to determine the earliest time at which all members are connected (i.e., every member is a friend of a friend of a friend ... of a friend). Assume that the log file is sorted by timestamp and that friendship is an equivalence relation. The running time of your algorithm should be mlogn or better and use extra space proportional to n
